  ATTRIBUTE DIRECTIVES

  There are three kinds of DIRECTIVES in Angular:
    1. Components -- directives with a template.
    2. Structural directives [ngFor, NgIf] -- change the DOM layout by adding and removing DOM elements.
    3. Attribute directives [NgStyle] -- change the apprearance or behavior of an elemnt, component, or another directives.
  
  There are 2 kinds of ATTRIBUTE DIRECTIVES:
    1. Class-based: -- A full-featured attribute directive, implemented using a class.
    2. Functional: A stateless attribute directive, implementd using a top-lelvel function.
  
  CLASS BASED attirbute directives:
    -- Creating a class-based attribute directive requires writing a controller class annotated with
       @Directive(), which specifies the selector that identifies the attribute. The controller class
       implements the desired diretive behavior.

       EXAMPLE:

       HTML: 
              <p myHighlight>Highlight me!</p>
      
       DART:
              import 'dart:html';

              import 'package:angular/angular.dart';

              @Directive(selector: '[myHighlight]')
              class HighlightDirective {
                HighlightDirective(Element el) {
                  el.style.backgroundColor = 'yellow';
                }
              }            
  
        @Directives() requries a CSS selector to identify the HTML in the template that is associated with
        the directive. The CSS selector for an attribute is the attribute name in the square brackets.

              why call it myHightlight :
                -- a best practice is to prefix selector names to ensure they don't conflict with standard
                HTML attributes. This also reduces the risk of colliding with third-party directive names.
              
        Angular creates a new instance of the directive's controller class for each matching element, injecting an HTML
        Element into the constructor.

  Apply the attribute directive:
        1. There must always a parent component or AppComponent in order to show it.

          EX:
              directives: [autoIdDirective, HighlightDirective],

  Respond to user-initiated events:
        -- The diretive could be more dynamic. It could detect when the user mouses into or out of the element
        and respond by setting or clearing the highlightcolor.

        Add two eventhandlers that respond when the mouse enters or leaves, each adorned by the HostListener
        annotation.


        EXAMPLE:
              @HostListener('mouseenter')
              void onMouseEnter() {
               _highlight('yellow');
              }

              @HostListener('mouseleave')
              void onMouseLeave() {
               _highlight();
              }

              void _highlight([String color]) {
               _el.style.backgroundColor = color;
              }

              Of course you could reach into the DOM with standard JavaScript and and attach event listeners manually.
              There are at least three problems with that approach:

                  +You have to write the listeners correctly.
                  +The code must detach the listener when the directive is destroyed to avoid memory leaks.
                  +Talking to DOM API directly isnâ€™t a best practice.

    // Here we have host listener.

    Bind to a second property:
    
    How to bind to a second property when you're already binding to the myHighlight attribute name?
            -> string them alow in the temlate.

            EX:
                <p [myHighlight]="color" defaultColor="violet">
                  Highlight me too!
                </p>

  Pass values into the directive with an @Input data binding:

  Write a functional directive: (insteads of adding @Directive to class, now at it to function)
          

  You can do @Input OR @Input('you-own-define-name')

    - It adds metadata to the class that makes the directive's highlightColor property available for binding.
    - Without the input metadata, Angular rejects the binding.



COMPONENT STYLES:
  
  Angular apps are styled with standard CSS. That means you can apply everything you about CSS stylesheets, selectors
  rules, and media queries directly to Angular apps.

  -> Additionally, you can bundle styles with components enabling a more modular design than regular stylesheets.
  // besically this is nothing new.

  Special selectors:

    Angular supports a few special selectors from the world of shadown DOM style scoping.
    
    :host and :host()
    
    host selector is the only way to target the host element. You can't reach the host element from inside
    the component with other selectors because it's not part of the component's own template.
    The host element is in a parent component's template.

    Use the function form :host() to apply host styles conditionally by ncluding another selector
    inside parethenses after : host.

    EXAMPLE:

                :host(.active) {
                  border-width: 3px;
                }
  
    :host-context()

    Sometimes it's useful to apply styles based on some condition outside of a component's view. For example,
    a CSS theme class could be applied to the document <body> element, and you want to change how your component
    looks based on that.

    Use the :host-context() pseudo-class selector, which works just like the function form of :host(). The :host-context()
    selector looks for a CSS class in any ancestor of the component host element, up to the document root.
    The :host-context() selector is seful when combined with another selector.

    ::ng-deep
    Component styles normally apply only to the HTML in the component's own template.
    Use the ::ng-deep selector to force a style down through the child compoent tree into all the child 
    component views. The ::ng-deep selector works to any depth of nested components, and it
    applies to both the view child and content children of the component.

    EXAMPLE:
      :host ::ng-deep h3 {
        font-style: italic;
      }

    [ABOVE] Component style apply from host element down through this component to all of its child elements in the DOM.

    Loading styles into components:

    There are several ways to add styles to a component.
    By setting styles or styleUrls metadata.
    Inline in the template HTML
    With CSS imports. (you import at CSS file.)
      EXAMPLE: @import 'hero_details_box.css'; (int file_name.css)

  Controlling view encapsulation:
    By default, component styles are encapsulated, affecting only the HTML in the component's template.
    You can use the secial selectors to reach outside of the component's view, or you can disable
    view encapsulation completely for the component.
    
 SERVICES
 
 logging service, data service,
 This is a logging file 
 
 class Logger{
  void log(Object msg) => window.console.log(msg);
  void error(Object msg) => window.console.log(msg);
  ...
 }
 
 Component classes should be lean. They don't have to fetch data from the server, validate user input,
 or log directly to the console. ---[[A component's job is to enable the user experience nothing more]]---.
 It mediates between the view (rendered by the template) and the application logic (which often includes
 some notion of a model). A good component presents properties and methods for data binding. It delegate
 everything nontrivial to services.abstract
 
 DEPENDENCY INJECTION
 
 When Angular creates a component, it first asks an injector for the services hey the component requires.
 An injector maintains a container of service instances that it has previously created. If a requested service
 instance is not in the container, the injector makes one and adds it to the container before returning
 the service to Angular.
 
 A provider care create or return a service, and is often the service class itself.abstract
 
 You can register providers with a component, or through the root ijector when the app is lauched.
 Registering the provider with a component means you get a new instance of the service with each new instance
 of that component. A service provided through a component is shared with all of the component's descendants
 in the app component tree.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DISPLAYING DATA

-- interpolation {{myGouvis}}
-- Angular updates the display when these properties change.

More precisely, the redisplay occurs after some kind of asynchronous event related to the view,
such as keystroke, a timer completion, or a response to an HTTP request.

Template inline or template file ?

The choice between inline and separate HTML is a matter of taste, circumstances, and organization policy.
(bottomline: it doesn't matter.)

-- when putting directives in template, you have to put them in.

Conditional display with NgIf (just use it, Angular has intellsense)
The template expression inside the double quote, *ngIf = "heros.length > 3"

*** NgIf DOES NOT show and hide the message. It ADD or REMOVE element from DOM.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

USER INPUT

User action such as clicking a link, pushing a button, and entering text raise DOM event.

Binding to user input events:

  <button (click)="onClickMe()">text</button>
  (click): event
  onClickMe(): function

Get user input from the $event object:
 DOM events carry a payload of information that may be useful to the component:

 class KeyUp1Component {
   String values = '';
 
   void onKey(dynamic event) {
     values += event.target.value + ' | ';
   }
 }

<input (keyup)="onKey($event)"> (if you use inline, but \ before $)
<p>{{values}}</p>

TypeEvent:

Although using dynamic type simplifies the code a bit, using a more specific type can reveal properties
of the event object and prevent silly mistakes.

class KeyUp1Component {
  String values = '';

  void onKey(KeyboardEvent event) {
    InputElement el = event.target;
    values += '${el.value}  | ';
  }
}

Passing $event is a dubious practice.
-- Typing the event object reveals a significant issue with passing the entire DOM event
into the method: the component is closely tied to the template details. The component
can't extract data without using web APIs. That breaks the separation of concerns between
the template and the component.

Get user input from a template reference variable. (THIS IS THE RIGHT WAY)

Angular template reference variables provide direct access to an element from within
the template. The declare a template reference variable, precede an identifier with 
a hash character(#)

@Component(
  selector: 'loop-back',
  template: '''
    <input #box (keyup)="onKey(box.value)">
    <p>{{values}}</p>
  ''',
)
class LoopBackComponent {
  String values = '';
  void onKey(value) => values += '$value | ';
}

// Must bind to an event.

Key event filtering (with key.enter)

@Component(
  selector: 'key-up3',
  template: '''
    <input #box (keyup.enter)="values=box.value">
    <p>{{values}}</p>
  ''',
)
class KeyUp3Component {
  String values = '';
}

On Blur
In the previous excample, the current state of the input box is lost if the user clicks elsewhere
on the page without first pressing Enter. The component's value property is updated only when the
user presses Enter.

To fix this issue, listen to both the Enter key and the blur event.

@Component(
  selector: 'key-up4',
  template: '''
    <input #box
      (keyup.enter)="values=box.value"
      (blur)="values=box.value">
    <p>{{values}}</p>
  ''',
)
class KeyUp4Component {
  String values = '';
}


Use template variables to refer to elements. The newHero template variable refers to the <input> element. 
You can reference newHero from any sibling or child of the <input> element.

Pass values, not elements. Instead of passing the newHero into the componentâ€™s addHero() method, get the
input box value and pass that to addHero().

Keep template statements simple. The (blur) event is bound to two statements. The first statement calls 
addHero(). The second statement, newHero.value='', clears the input box after a new hero is added to the list

==========================
FORM

Forms are the mainstay of business apps.

-- two-way data binding
-- change tracking
-- validation
-- error handling

Now you need to display, listen, and extract at the same time.

<mark>{{model.name}}</mark><hr>
<div class="form-group">
  <label for="name">Name&nbsp;*</label>
  <input type="text" class="form-control" id="name" required
         [(ngModel)]="model.name"
         ngControl="name">
</div>

You added a diagnostic interpolation before the form-group so you can see what
you are doing. You left yourself a note to threw it away.

The diangostic is evidence that values really are flowing from the input to the
model and back again.

Internally, Angular creates NgFormControl instances and registers then with an
NgForm directive that Angular attached to the <form> tag. Each NgFormControl is
registered under the name you assigned to the ngControl directive. You'll read
more about NgForm later in this guide.

FINAL FORM STYLE:

<mark>{{model}}</mark><hr>
<div class="form-group">
  <label for="name">Name&nbsp;*</label>
  <input type="text" class="form-control" id="name" required
         [(ngModel)]="model.name"
         ngControl="name">
</div>
<div class="form-group">
  <label for="alterEgo">Alter Ego</label>
  <input type="text" class="form-control" id="alterEgo"
         [(ngModel)]="model.alterEgo"
         ngControl="alterEgo">
</div>
<div class="form-group">
  <label for="power">Hero Power&nbsp;*</label>
  <select class="form-control" id="power" required
          [(ngModel)]="model.power"
          ngControl="power">
    <option *ngFor="let p of powers" [value]="p">{{p}}</option>
  </select>
</div>

Each input element has an id property that is used by the label element's for
attribute to match the label to its input control.

Each input element has a ngControl directive that is required by Angular forms
to register the control with the form.

Style controls:

The valid control property is the most interesting, because you want to send a strong visual
signal when a control value is invalid. To create suck visual feedback, you will use the
Bootstrap custom-forms classes is-valid and is-invalid.

Add a template reference variable called name to the Name <input> tag and use it to display
the input's CSS classes.

<input type="text" class="form-control" id="name" required
       [(ngModel)]="model.name"
       #name="ngForm"
       #spy
       [class.is-valid]="name.valid"
       [class.is-invalid]="!name.valid"
       ngControl="name">
       
 TODO: remove the next diagnostic line 
{{spy.className}}

The spy template reference variable gets bound to the <input> DOM element, whereas the name variable gets
bound to the NgModel associated with the input element.

Why "ngForm" ? A Directive's exportAs property tells Angular how to link the reference variable to the 
directive. You set name to "ngForm" because the ngModel directive's exportAs property is "ngForm"<div class="">

As an alternative to class bindings, you can use an NgClass directive to style a control.

Map<String, bool> setCssValidityClass(NgControl control) {
  final validityClass = control.valid == true ? 'is-valid' : 'is-invalid';
  return {validityClass: true};
}

.... THESE CONCEPT of NgForm needs a lot more understanding.

Show and hide validation error messages:

You can improve the form. The Name input is required, and clearing it turns the out outline red. That says
something is wrong but the user doesn't know what is wrong or what to do about it.
Leverage the control's state to reveal a helpful message.

The achieve this effect, andd the following immediately after the Name <input>:

<div [hidden]= "name.valid || name.pristine" class="invalid-feedback">
  Name is required.
</div>

You control visibility of the error message by setting the hidden attribute of the <div> based on the state
of the name control.

User experience is the developer's choice

Some developers want the message to display at all times. If you ignore the pristine state, you would hide the message
only when the value is valid. If you arrive in this component with a new (blank) hero or an invalid hero,
you'll see the error message immediately, before you've done anything.

Some developers want the message to display only when the user makes an invalid change. Hiding the message while the
control is "pristine" achieves that goal.

Submit the form with ngSubmit:

The user would be able to submit this form after filling it in. The Submit button at the bottom of the form
does nothing on its own, but it will trigger a form submit because of its type (type="submit")



<form (ngSubmit)="onSubmit()" #heroForm="ngForm">

NgForm directive:

Angular automatically creates and attaches an NgForm directive to the <form> tag.

The NgForm directive supplements the form element with additional features. It holds the controls 
you created for the elemtns with ngModel and ngCotrl directives, and monitors their properties, including their validity.

<button [disabled]="!heroForm.form.valid" type="submit" class="btn btn-primary">
  Submit
</button>

// NGFORM MUST BE INCLUED MORE



As can be expected for a demo. Jazzing up the demo

  Basic Routing:

  1- To tell Angular that your app uses the router, specify "routerProvidersHash"
     in your app's bootstrap function.

  2- Set the base href (like in sample folder)
  3- For production: set <base href="/">

  4- Routes:
    a. Define route path for each app's view.
       (by defining route paths in a separate file, you can void circular dependencies between route definitions in apps
       with a rich navigational structure)
    
    b. Then update the AppComponent (html, css...)

  5- RouteOutlet:
    a. is one of the routerDirectives.
    b. To use a router directive like "RouterOutlet" within a component, add it
       individually to the component's directives list, or for convenience you can
       add the router Directives list.
  
  6- RouterLinks:
    Users shouldn't have to paste a route path into the address bar. Instead, add  an anchor to the template that
    when clicked, triggers navigation to EmployeeListComponent (remember to update the AppComponent)
